Console application in C# that simulates caring for a virtual pet.

**Project Description: Virtual Pet Simulator**

The Virtual Pet Simulator is an interactive console application that allows users to create and care for a virtual pet. Users can choose a pet type, name their pet, and perform various actions to maintain its health, happiness, and hunger levels.

#Detailed Project Features

1. **Pet Creation:**

Users can select a pet type (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit).
Users can give their pet a custom name.
A welcome message is displayed, including the pet's type and name.

2. **Pet Care Actions:**

Feeding: Decreases hunger, slightly increases health.
Playing: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
Resting: Improves health, decreases happiness slightly.
Each action modifies the pet's stats and displays a message describing the effect.
