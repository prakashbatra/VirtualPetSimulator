Console application in C# that simulates caring for a virtual pet.
Detailed Project Features:
1.	Pet Creation:
•	Allow the user to choose a pet type (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit) and give it a name.
•	Display a welcome message that includes the pet's type and name.
2.	Pet Care Actions:
•	Implement actions such as:
•	Feeding: Decreases hunger, slightly increases health.
•	Playing: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
•	Resting: Improves health, decreases happiness slightly.
•	Each action should modify the pet's stats accordingly and display a message describing the action's effect.


3.	Pet Status Monitoring:
•	Track and display pet’s stats: hunger, happiness, and health, each on a scale of 1 to 10.
•	Implement a status check that warns the user if any stat is critically low or high.
4.	Time-Based Changes:
•	Simulate the passage of time, where each action represents the passing of an hour.
•	Hunger increases over time, and happiness decreases slightly, prompting regular interaction.
5.	Enhanced Interaction Logic:
•	Implement consequences for neglect, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
•	Include special messages or events based on the pet's status (e.g., the pet refusing to play if too hungry).
